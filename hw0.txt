# Description of your program (part 7)

Create an empty list to keep track of existing words seen.

Begin at the first word of the document.

For each word you come across moving forward in the document:

    If the current word is in the list you created earlier, move on to the next word.

    If the current word is not in the list, add it to your list and move on to the next word.

Once you are at the end of the document, count how many words are in your list of existing words.

Return this counted number as the word count.

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)

I have written pseudo-code many, many times in previous courses so this was fairly easy.

This varied from pseudo-code though because I wanted to make the conditional more intuitive by adding a
conditional for if the current word was already in the list created earlier. This is because the person
following instructions may question what to do if this happens, unlike a computer which would ignore this
without question. I suppose this was unsatisfying because this is something I had to specify in this explanation
compared to if I just wrote code/pseudo-code for it.
